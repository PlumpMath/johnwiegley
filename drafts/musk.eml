Hi Fedros,

I liked your question this evening, and thought it deserved a bit more time,
so please forgive me if I send you these thoughts on the "wine sealed by
musk".

The place this reference comes from is Qur'=C3=A1n 83:25-26:

  (25) And they are given to drink of a sealed wine, (26) whose seal is mus=
k.
  For the like of this let the travailers travail!

This is quoted by Bah=C3=A1'u'll=C3=A1h in the second of The Four Valleys:

  Wherefore, a man should make ready his heart that it be worthy of the
  descent of heavenly grace, and that the bounteous Cup-Bearer may give him=
 to
  drink of the wine of bestowal from the merciful vessel. =E2=80=9CFor the =
like of
  this let the travailers travail!=E2=80=9D

There are many other references to this wine, all of them likening it to His
Revelation:

  I have, moreover, with the hand of divine power, unsealed the choice wine=
 of
  My Revelation, and have wafted its holy, its hidden, and musk-laden
  fragrance upon all created things.

  Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay, rather,
  We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might and power.

  Renounce all created things, and quaff the sealed wine of My remembrance.

  Well is it with him... who hath quaffed, with unswerving resolve, and in =
the
  name of the Self-Subsisting, the sealed wine of His Revelation.

  The seal of the choice Wine of His Revelation hath, in this Day and in His
  Name, the Self-Sufficing, been broken.

  Take heed lest anything deter thee from extolling the greatness of this D=
ay
  -- the Day whereon the Finger of majesty and power hath opened the seal of
  the Wine of Reunion...

  The Best-Beloved is come. In His right hand is the sealed Wine of His nam=
e.

One thing to note about this "choice wine" is that the Arabic phrase is
actually "rah=C3=ADqun makht=C3=BAmun". Rah=C3=ADq can mean both "exquisite=
 wine", and
nectar, the source of honey. And two of the rivers in paradise are wine and
honey... :)

Now, the question you asked was: Why is this Wine sealed with musk?

There is a powerful connection in the Writings between discerning scent and=
 a
spiritual capacity to recognize the true nature of the Manifestations of Go=
d.
This connection of fragrance to recognition is also a powerful motif is the
story of Joseph, which Bah=C3=A1'u'll=C3=A1h references on multiple occasio=
ns:

  And if, by the help of God, he findeth on this journey a trace of the
  traceless Friend, and inhaleth the fragrance of the long-lost Joseph from
  the heavenly messenger, he shall straightway step into the Valley of Love
  and be dissolved in the fire of love.

Or in the =C3=8Dq=C3=A1n where Bah=C3=A1'u'll=C3=A1h writes:

  We seal Our theme with that which was formerly revealed unto Muhammad that
  the seal thereof may shed the fragrance of that holy musk which leadeth m=
en
  unto the Ridv=C3=A1n of unfading splendour.

`Abdu'l-Bah=C3=A1 also uses the image of the choice wine and the musk:

  As to you, O ye loved ones of God! Loose your tongues and offer Him thank=
s;
  praise ye and glorify the Beauty of the Adored One, for ye have drunk from
  this purest of chalices, and ye are cheered and set aglow with this wine.=
 Ye
  have detected the sweet scents of holiness, ye have smelled the musk of
  faithfulness from Joseph's raiment.

And in another place, associating musk with spiritual revival:

  One's conduct must be like the conduct of Paul, and one's faith similar to
  that of Peter. This musk-scented breeze shall perfume the nostrils of the
  people of the world, and this spirit shall resuscitate the dead.

So, this Wine symbolizes God's Revelation, and the musk -- its beauty, its
fragrance, its life-giving breath -- attracts us to it. This only leaves the
question: why is it sealed with this musk? This actually connects to
Brittany's question of why Noah was given prophecy that God did not fulfill,
but I'm afraid this e-mail has become too long already!

Yours, John
