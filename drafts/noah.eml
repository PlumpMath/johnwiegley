Hi Brittany,

Your question about Noah struck was a compelling one, and I had wanted to s=
ay
more during the meeting, but it's a tricky subject and hard to phrase ideas
quick enough not to distract the group. But e-mail is another story. :)

Why did Noah prophesize events that did not come to pass, on multiple
occasions?

In the Sur=C3=ADy-i-Vaf=C3=A1 (Tablet of Fidelity), Bah=C3=A1'u'll=C3=A1h w=
rites:

  Moreover, thou shouldst not perceive the fulfilment of the Return and the
  Resurrection save in the Word of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing.
  For instance, were He to take a handful of earth and declare it to be the
  One Whom ye have been following in the past, it would undoubtedly be just
  and true, even as His real Person, and to none is given the right to
  question His authority. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever
  He pleaseth.

In effect, true belief must be based on the Manifestation Himself, and His
word, and not according to any earthly standard, such as what men understand
of justice, truth, righteousness, mercy, or any other thing. Only such Faith
is befitting to Him.

When Noah gave his unfilled prophecy, the correct response would have been =
for
those believers to say, "Gracious God, the prophecy has been fulfilled", ev=
en
if their own eyes were unable to perceive the truth of it. In the same way,
the divines of each age have persecuted and put to death the Messengers of
God, because they weighed matters in the scale of their own judgment, so too
believing the prophecies had remained unfulfilled, and invalidating in their
eyes the claims of the Promised One.

The real standard is His statement, "He doeth what He pleaseth. He chooseth;
and none may question His choice. Whatsoever He, the Well-Beloved, ordainet=
h,
the same is, verily, beloved." In the Gems of Divine Mysteries, He writes:

  And should he encounter One Who layeth claim to a Cause from God, and Who
  holdeth from His Lord a testimony beyond the power of men to produce, he
  must needs follow Him in all that He pleaseth to proclaim, command and
  ordain, even were He to decree the sea to be land, or to pronounce earth =
to
  be heaven, or that the former lieth above the latter or below it, or to
  ordain any change or transformation, for He, verily, is aware of the
  celestial mysteries, the unseen subtleties, and the ordinances of God.

Even though Noah appeared to be giving prophecy that was not outwardly
fulfilled, in reality it both was fulfilled, and tested the quality of
mankind's faith. Did they believe due to their acceptance of the Manifestat=
ion
for His own sake, or according to their own reasoning and knowledge?

A similar thing happened when Muhammad changed the point of the Qiblih,
mid-prayer, without explanation, causing several of His followers to leave =
and
abandon their religion. They had placed their Faith in a fancy of their own
imagining, and not His blessed Person.

At the end of the story of Noah in the Kit=C3=A1b-i-=C3=8Dq=C3=A1n, Bah=C3=
=A1'u'll=C3=A1h writes:

  ... from time immemorial even unto eternity the Almighty hath tried, and
  will continue to try, His servants, so that light may be distinguished fr=
om
  darkness, truth from falsehood, right from wrong, guidance from error,
  happiness from misery, and roses from thorns. Even as He hath revealed: "=
Do
  men think when they say `We believe' they shall be let alone and not be p=
ut
  to proof?"

Such faith must be rooted in the heart, and not based on agreement in the m=
ind
alone. With sufficient examination and reflection, the hidden, inner meanin=
gs
may be brought be light; but we must proceed on the assumption that His kno=
ws,
and we do not know. The followers of Noah were tested according to their
expectations, and judged according to their deeds. It became an object less=
on
that has been repeated again and again, whenever prophecy has failed to take
the forms expected by men.

  If the mystic knowers be of those who have reached to the beauty of the
  Beloved One, this station is the apex of consciousness and the secret of
  divine guidance. This is the center of the mystery: "He doth what He
  willeth, ordaineth what He pleaseth."

  Were all the denizens of earth and heaven to unravel this shining allusio=
n,
  this darksome riddle, until the Day when the Trumpet soundeth, yet would
  they fail to comprehend even a letter thereof, for this is the station of
  God's immutable decree, His foreordained mystery. Hence, when searchers
  inquired of this, He made reply, "This is a bottomless sea which none sha=
ll
  ever fathom." And they asked again, and He answered, "It is the blackest =
of
  nights through which none can find his way."

Yours, John
