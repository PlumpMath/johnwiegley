My name is [John Wiegley](mailto:jwiegley@gmail.com) (the last name pronounced
exactly as the word "wiggly", two syllables). I'm a computer systems
programmer by day (and night), and as well a thinker, poet, and philosopher.
People often describe me as a bit intense, a dreamer, sometimes a tad crazy.
Since college, I have heard people telling me to "Wake up" -- yet I still
prefer to dream.

To me, God is the ultimate of all that is good and wonderful, as well as the
purpose behind everything evil and horrible. There is much written about this
in my essays. In a word, God is quality to me, and whatever has quality
manifests God. I think of my soul as that part of me which longs for that part
of Him, wherever in the world I find it.

As a [Bahá'í](http://www.bahai.org/), I follow the teachings and institutions
of [Bahá'u'lláh](http://www.bahaullah.org/), about which more may be found
here. In some ways I am a very religious person, while in others I am not at
all. I don't think religion and spirituality always connect, and there is no
human organization that will ever be perfect.

That said, I do believe the world is headed for wonderful things, with a phase
of painful transition between. I dedicate myself to what will come on the
other side, and make my efforts and plans in those terms.

My background is Germanic, and I am a lover of travel and languages. I also
have many hobbies, and develop fascinations quickly and fiercely. It can be
anything too, from books to knives to soap. I never know myself what will
capture my interest next.
