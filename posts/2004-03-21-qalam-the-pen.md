    Each man is himself a pen:  
    a slim reed  
    cut from the bed of possibility,  
    fired in the pain and trials of life,  
    until the crack  
    that is his central flaw  
    fills with the ink of yearning  
    and bright tales appear --  
    from so humble a tool --  
    to tell of our Master's beauty.
