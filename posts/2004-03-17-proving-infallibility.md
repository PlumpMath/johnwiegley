If you examine only His statement of infallibility, it *is* circular.
It's no more proof than if I said so.

He states "His own person" as the reason for true belief.  During the
latter 1800s, this meant visiting Bahá'u'lláh Himself, and hearing His
voice.  This was the basis of belief for many early Bahá'ís, who could
neither read nor write.  In "Gleanings" Bahá'u'lláh writes:

> ... His (God's) Manifestation can adduce no greater proof of the truth
> of His Mission than the proof of His own Person.[^1]

After His passing, there remain two elements of "His own person": the
record of His deeds, and His writings.  I myself am sceptical of
historical record, so I turn to the depth of His writings for ample
testimony that He is no plain author.  There is too much consistency
over a long period, no backtracking, no revising of theories that became
outmoded as the years passed.  But these are just what impressed me.

> Question: *Do you believe Bahá'u'lláh was literally omniscient?*

He describes Himself in these terms:

> ... this Servant regardeth Himself as utterly lost and as nothing,
> even beside one of the beloved of God, how much less in the presence
> of His holy ones.

That is what He thought of Himself, as Mirzá Husayn-`Alí.  But even as a
book speaks the mind of its author -- more than just ink and paper -- so
the Will of God was revealed by Bahá'u'lláh.  In Him, and His words and
actions, divine purpose was made incarnate.  To emphasize this station,
He wrote the following:

> The essence of belief in Divine unity consisteth in regarding Him Who
> is the Manifestation of God and Him Who is the invisible, the
> inaccessible, the unknowable Essence as one and the same.  By this is
> meant that whatever pertaineth to the former, all His acts and doings,
> whatever He ordaineth or forbiddeth, should be considered, in all
> their aspects, and under all circumstances, and without any
> reservation, as identical with the Will of God Himself.  This is the
> loftiest station to which a true believer in the unity of God can ever
> hope to attain.  Blessed is the man that reacheth this station, and is
> of them that are steadfast in their belief.[^2]

You might say it is a question of being.  To say Bahá'u'lláh is equal
with God can mean several things, some of them true, some of them false.
Consider when I pick up the telephone.  It's my brother calling.  Now a
young child asks, "Is that your brother?"  I say, "Yes".  But what if he
were asking about the plastic and machinery itself?

Bahá'u'lláh disregarded His own flesh, and proclaimed it dust.  He said
the same is true of all men.  What is real about us is our spirit, the
virtues we embody, and our faith.  Well, when they bury me, it's not me
they're putting in the box.  So which am I?  The man, or what animates
the man?  Bahá'u'lláh was a man just like you and I.  But what animated
Him was of a different order altogether.
