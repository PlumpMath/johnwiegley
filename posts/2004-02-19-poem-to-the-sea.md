    I watch you, my friend,  
    your vast belly  
    undulating in rhythms  
    to some mystic dance;  
    your gentle suspirations  
    and balming murmurs  
    that leave the heart entranced;  
    your cold and watery hues:  
    now green in the shallows  
    now black in the depths --  
    where uncounted fathoms  
    halt the light's advance:  
    I call you the sea --  
    but every moment you change.  
    You defy my conceptions.  
    You swallow whole  
    my ships of fancy --  
    as you wash away the words  
    I write upon your sands.
