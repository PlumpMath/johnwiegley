    Blue and black it all becomes  
    as the moths begin their night journey.

    I have never found peace when I looked for it;  
    but when I rest from the task, somehow, it finds me.

    I'm never able to summon joy at my command;  
    but when I cease demanding, and let things be, there it is.

    A smile is an awful thing to force;  
    but a ray of errant sun when it appears.
