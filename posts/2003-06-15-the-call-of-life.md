    We live to live  
    have choice to choose  
    freedom to err and succeed  
    time to grow, to act  
    death to humble us  
    and life to shine with glory.  
    We need no one but ourselves  
    to be who we are.

    It takes many hands to raise a building  
    but only if each does its own work  
    and does it well.
