Today a poem, using the well-known metaphor of [The Candle](the.candle) to depict the
heights of mystic love -- in which the lover becomes as nothing in
devotion to his friend.  Or as Bahá'u'lláh words it in *The Seven
Valleys*:

> For when the true lover and devoted friend reacheth to the presence of
> the Beloved, the sparkling beauty of the Loved One and the fire of the
> lover's heart will kindle a blaze and burn away all veils and
> wrappings.  Yea, all he hath, from heart to skin, will be set aflame,
> so that nothing will remain save the Friend.
