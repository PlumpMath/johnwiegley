    Be happy!  
    Be so happy  
    that clouds will lose their burdens,  
    the dawn comes eagerly,  
    and starlings give their melodies away.

    And shine!  
    O ray of the Sun,  
    until glaciers melt, giving up their sadness  
    to the blue, blue waters,  
    where, now reunited, they can play.
