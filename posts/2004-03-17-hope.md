    In the cracks of the sidewalk  
    I saw pale, violet flowers growing:

    Sensitive, timid,  
    but with that soulful beauty  
    only nature and children possess.

    It was then I knew not to despair;  
    that perhaps in the fissures of a broken heart,  
    pale, violet flowers might grow.
