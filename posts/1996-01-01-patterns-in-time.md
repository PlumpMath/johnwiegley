There's something about patterns that only occur in a dilated time view,
as if, by stepping back, the mosaic against which we do all of the
things that we do reveals the context of the underlying desires that
drove the momentary ones.  Maybe it's only in that way that we ever
contact the more inward drives that we have: the things we don't see
because our attention is too narrowly focused on the moment.
