    Even as mystery is an air  
    which surrounds us in the dead of night;

    And silence has its own sound,  
    audible as a deafening roar  
    when truly we hear it deeply:

    So everything about us has  
    a deeper nature,  
    a second skin,  
    which requires our utmost attention to perceive it.

    Otherwise,  
    in the falling leaves of the redwoods  
    one sees nothing but those leaves,  
    and misses them for the wonderful tapestry they are.
