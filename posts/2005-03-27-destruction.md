    If poetry is devastating,  
    let me be destroyed.

    If love is painful,  
    let me hurt.

    Just so,  
    as the flames burn  
    please care for my ashes.

    I may not know what I ask for --  
    but I do know this:  
      The life that I've lived so far  
      is not how I want to die.
