    I shall cast upon the mountains --  
      as a clarion call! --  
    the name of my Beloved;  
    and commit to paper  
    such tales of loving mention,  
    all will be astonished.

    Whatever names you knew of Love  
    before this -- forget them!

    The beating of every lover's heart  
    will be the sound of my communion.
