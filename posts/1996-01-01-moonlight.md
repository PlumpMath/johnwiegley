    The light is pure,  
    even as a wash of something  
    cool and bright  
    that refreshes me  
    despite the lateness of the hour.

    Work, and the grind of day,  
    have left me hollowed out,  
    an old soul,  
    full of empty dreams and memories  
    of my youth, crazy and reckless;  
    when days would not end  
    and nights quickly slipped away...

    I stare in emptiness and quietude,  
    as she pours her white, mother's milk;  
    until my lips, where anguish lived,  
    return to a warm, moonlit grin.
