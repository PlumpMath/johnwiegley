    They spill like a sea,  
    all walking, tan and colored drops,  
    into the greater, deeper sea...

    One blue, above, endless from east to west  
    but for its radiant Jewel;  
    the other, blue, lapping at the sand,  
    receiving great hordes --  
    this clash of seas, splashing, playing...

    And the boats wander by --  
    the arms, the legs! --  
    and wander by again.
