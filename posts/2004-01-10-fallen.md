My brother introduced me today to the album "Fallen", by Evanescence.
This is one of the best all-around albums I've heard in a long time,
which my brother says also.  I was already a fan of the song "Bring Me
to Life" on that album, but I find I like most of the songs on it.
Especially "My Immortal", which is truly ethereal in its beauty.
