Location: 7373 N. 71st Place, Paradise Valley, Arizona

    I feel your peace on quiet nights  
    when the cool winds presage rain.

    Later your joy rises, with its gentle warmth  
    to dry the dewdrops weighing the leaves.

    Your beauty sings like songbirds on branches  
    or crickets pleading with the star-filled night.

    Your bright qualities are indeed my Charon:  
    for their sublime touch ferries me to other worlds.
