I have arrived safely back home in San Francisco -- where it is *much*
warmer than New Jersey, though still a jacket is needed.  In a few days
I'm driving down to Los Angeles and Arizona, where I think I can catch
an early glimpse of summer.

It has been a long day already and I am heading to bed now, but first a
poem, written to greet the welcome sight of a rolling ocean outside my
window.
