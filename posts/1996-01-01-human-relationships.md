Our relationship with our spouse can be our closest relationship to God.
Proof:

1. Everything in existence is a reflection of God's attributes.

1. Man, above all, is endowed with the capacity to reflect all of God's
attributes.

1. Our contact with our spouse is the closest contact we will ever have
with another human being, on all levels.

1. God, in His Essence, is unknowable.  We can only relate to Him
through His attributes.

1. The greater our relationship to those attributes, the greater our
relationship to God.

1. Since man, above all, reflects His attributes more truly than
anything else, then through man, the greatest relationship with His
attributes is possible.

1. Therefore, if our spouse represents our closest human contact, they
are also potentially our greatest experience of God.
