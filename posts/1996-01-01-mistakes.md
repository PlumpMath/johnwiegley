Mistakes are not just a thing that happens, they are the ebb and flow of
our lives.  Do not think that mistakes will debar future service,
because people will remember them and hold them against us.  If God
wishes us to serve in a certain capacity, He will achieve it.  We should
even be glad of mistakes for their value, and rejoice in them, because
the alternative is to be ignorant of the fact that we make them all the
time.  Being aware is about being conscious; it doesn't relate to the
actual number of mistakes occurring.
