    Without the light  
    it would not be seen;  
    without eyes  
    it would not be seen.

    Between these two forms of nothing  
    a being of phenomenon  
    neither in the object  
    or the eye or the light.

    But there... a subtle shading of rose  
    shaped into a smile  
    beneath eyes  
    like my own hope given form.

    There... what is that shaft  
    pushing its way into the labors of my heart?  
    ruining the moment's peace  
    and offering something  
    I would live without peace for  
    day upon day again.

    Between two different kinds of void:  
    a thing to die for.
