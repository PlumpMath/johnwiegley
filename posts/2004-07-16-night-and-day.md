    If all the world is perfect  
    within a grander scheme,  
    tomorrow's bitter cup  
    is sweeter than it seems.

    If eyes be taught this Way  
    of seeing past the veil,  
    they'd find an end to pain;  
    so would happiness prevail!

    For darkness hasn't essence  
    to bear against the Light;  
    whose first arrows of dawn  
    are fatal to the night.

    Until they ask:  
    Mustn't night, too, succeed day?  
    To which I answer:  
    The Sun never sets;  
      it's the Earth that turns away.
