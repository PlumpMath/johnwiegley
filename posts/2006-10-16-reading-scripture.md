    If a wise man speaks to a fool,  
    he will use the fool's language --  
    lest the language of the wise  
    lead him to greater folly.

    Yet if the fool pays too much heed  
    to the words and forms adopted,  
    he will mostly see in them  
    the shape of his own reflection...

    He should wonder less the form,  
    and more what could not fit it:

      Forget the drop, drying on your nose;  
      ponder the clouds and thunder.
