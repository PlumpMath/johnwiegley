    Tonight there is a storm in Italy,  
    angry in white shouts across the sky;  
    its massive brow furrowing in cumulus piles  
    grey upon black,  
    throwing down water on the heads,  
    leering, towering,  
    a heavy fist that shakes in fury,  
    wringing drops of its own, pallid blood  
    on the earth below.
