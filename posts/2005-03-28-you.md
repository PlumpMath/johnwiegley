    Tenderly, with your arms around me  
      your lips close to my ear  
      your head against my shoulder  
      your hair on my cheek  
      your warmth, surrounding me  
      your still, calming air  
      your eyes, mostly closed  
      your form next to mine  
      your breathing, soft and deep  
      your quiet silence  
      your gentle, stirring touch...

    You are everything I dream of  
    and nothing I can know --  
    without you here, beside me,  
    holding me just so...
