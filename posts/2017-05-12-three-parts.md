A long time ago I found that every truth I discovered about "God" was also, in
some way, a truth about "humanity", which in turn was a truth about "myself".
There is a realm in which all things have their proper place and station; and
there is another in which all things are united, rays of the same Sun. Yet
even these two realms are in harmony, like the sides of a coin, and work
toward the same purpose.
