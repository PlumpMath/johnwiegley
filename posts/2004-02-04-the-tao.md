Love loves because it is love, this is the way of the Tao.  Just as
water flows, ice hardens, rocks abide.  When life is like this, there is
no conflict.

When we see others as children of the same God, our true brothers, there
is no more "us" and "them", "serving" and "not serving"; to serve is
living and selfishness is death.

The Tao is motion and stillness together, striving and resting as one.
We inhale and exhale, eat and defecate.  When a mind seeks knowledge,
give it; when none does, don't.
