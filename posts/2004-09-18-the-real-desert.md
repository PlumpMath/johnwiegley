    The real desert  
    is a space between the mountains.  
    A hollow in the green and watered Earth.

    It stretches out  
    and fills with its own emptiness;  
    the silence is crowded  
    by a thousand unheard things.

    Its song of wind blows and blows  
    drifting the sands about.  
    I watch the long, lonely dance.  
    It is never and always the same.
