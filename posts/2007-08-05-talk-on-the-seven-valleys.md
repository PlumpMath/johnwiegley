Recently I had the opportunity to give a talk on the Seven Valleys at a
nearby Bahá'í school here in Colorado.  The A/V person was able to
record the talk as an MP3, which I offer here to anyone who's interested
in the topic.  Please be aware that all opinions are my own.  The files
are each around 40 MB in size.
