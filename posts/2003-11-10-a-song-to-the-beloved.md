    I seek someone, but who is she?  
    Or rather, who is She?

    In the faces that go by, not a one --  
    only inklings.

    Then other times,  
    when my heart and my eyes are clear,  
    I stop, to dream unholy dreams.

    And in such a dream  
    my lover speaks to me:  
    she makes the wind to be her voice.

    Her eyes, like stars in the night sky,  
    her hair a black moonlight  
    that brushes my cheeks.

    For she is that sky,  
    that pale and somber moon.  
    I call out to her in yearning pleas  
    and through my open door she comes.
