    How much do we ponder  
    the effect we have on each other's lives --  
    even if it goes no further than a single day,  
    no deeper than a conversation?

    Sometimes, our eyes as we walk away,  
    or a simple touch,  
    or laughter,  
    can mean everything to a person's heart.

    What we don't see  
    is how life prepares us  
    to understand this.
