    I asked a key  
    who had found his lock:

      "How did you know?  
      What did she say  
      to convince you?"

    He looked at me a while,  
    then told me:

      "It's wasn't so much  
      what she said --  
      as what she didn't:

      a seamless joining together;  
      a lack of noise  
      to proclaim ill-fitting;

      an absence of effort  
      where before  
      there had always been."
