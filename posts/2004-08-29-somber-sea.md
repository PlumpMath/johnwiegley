Location: Starbucks, Daly City, off of John Daly Blvd.

    The sea was somber, almost somnambulant --  
    the waves, even, unaware of their motion.

    I used that silence to hear the quiet,  
    to watch the milky moonlight  
    pour upon the waters,

    And gaze into a dark so deep  
    it seemed to fathom me.
