Location: 380 Esplanade #211

    You were my earth,  
    whom I touched to feel the solid ground.  
    My sky, clean and blue,  
    when ever I feared the rain.

    No siren call, of windswept seas,  
    could coax me from your shore:  
    my heaven, my earth,  
    whose ground I feel no more.
