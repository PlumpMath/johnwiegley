    What a fierce sun stares at me today.

    The roads shimmer in the air;  
    the lizards alone enjoy it.

    Through my tinted lenses  
    I watch the girls go by...

    Everyone talks of Fall  
    as if Spring had never been.

    The cup of water in my hand  
    is already warm!

    Summer, in Tempe, Ariona.
