    Virginia autumn, when leaves regale  
    with their moving, wordless tale;

    A language of signs, each painted leaf  
    like golden hands gone pale.

    What do they say, those flustered leaves,  
    filling both hill and dale?

    Perhaps they warn of winter's chill  
    or its biting, frosty veil;

    Or maybe they sorrow the loss of time  
    and run to cloak the trail.
