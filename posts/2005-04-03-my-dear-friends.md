    How can I say if I love God more,  
    or you, my dear friends?

    When I want to hear Him laugh,  
    I tell you the joke.

    When I want to ease His pain,  
    I offer you the balm.

    Whenever you smile, I see Him;  
    whenever you sigh, I hear Him:

    For if He is the Light  
    and you are His candles,

    I need add but a spark of love --  
    and suddenly He appears.
