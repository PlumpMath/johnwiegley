Sometimes I feel as though we are all candles, placed in a room, intended to
illuminate the vast treasures that are contained therein.  Some burn
brighter, some not at all, but the more of us that do, the greater the scope
of these grand visions.

But it seems that at some times I am more mesmerized by the lights than I am
by what they reveal.  Or I bemoan my own feebleness next to others; or I
feast on my pride next to still others.

But whether I am dim or bright; whether we are few or many; whether I am
held fast in the dust, or in the finest candelabra -- whenever I turn my
eyes toward the aim of our being, and that Face our inner light can best
reveal, it is then that all seems just as it should be.
