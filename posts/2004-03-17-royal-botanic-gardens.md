    Today my soul is a butterfly  
    not knowing where to light.

    My body takes rest on a pavilion  
    in years as old as itself.

    The bats around me wail  
    like insistent children, flocks of them.

    The air is still and calm,  
    the sun is hot --  
    this butterfly ready to roam.
