Starting from south of Phoenix, this month I went to Albuquerque, then
the Navajo reservation, then Flagstaff, back to Albuquerque, then to
Sante Fe, and at last up here to Colorado Springs.  Although I took more
than 500 pictures, only a few of them turned out to my taste.  Those
pictures can be seen [here](gallery/New%20Mexico/index.html).  The girl who appears in two of them is my
friend Marjan, who took me up to the top of Sandia Peak outside
Albuquerque.
