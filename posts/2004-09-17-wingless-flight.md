    Reaching for heaven,  
    I draw back fingers burnt by the sun;  
    and ponder the endless skies  
    my hands can never touch...

    Made from the dust of stars  
    I am planet bound --  
    longing to fly, but having no wings.

    Then let this poem be my flight:  
    I will gather up dreams  
    beneath wings of prayer  
    and traverse, in my mind's eye, every distance  
    until I leave this Earth behind  
    and, without moving,  
    stride among the heavens.
