    I was awed by life.

    And here I sit,  
    silent,  
    lost in that awe.

    A tree with its leaves shining;  
    the sky, a gradient blue;  
    pure white clouds fading in the sun:  
    a moment to appreciate.

    It may only be the view outside my window,  
    but who painted it?  
    thrilling my heart as any painter might --

    Striking awe into a being  
    now silent.
