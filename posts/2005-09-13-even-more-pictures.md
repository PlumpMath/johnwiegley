Been having lots of fun with the new camera lately.  It seems that
shooting from a tripod greatly improves the quality of the images (which
is really no surprise).  So here are [some new images](gallery/Colorado/Garden%20of%20the%20Gods/index.html) from the "Garden of
the Gods" in Colorado Springs.  Also, a few more pictures have been
added to the [Chicago gallery](gallery/Illinois/Chicago/index.html).
