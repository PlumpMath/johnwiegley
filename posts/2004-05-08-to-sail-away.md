    Globes of moonlight float along the water,  
    fishes nibble at the morsels of light;  
    I lean against the railing, hands pressed down,  
    closing my eyes to remember the sight...

    Sail on, lonely barque, carry me far --  
    Loose my spirit on the darkened seas!  
    I'll hear no more of heaven and earth:  
    only waves crashing and the constant breeze.
