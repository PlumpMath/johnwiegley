    A flower reaches to the sun:  
    it never touches, but achieves.

    The wind listens as we listen back;  
    the sea understands, the stars speak.

      Take away arms, I love you;  
      take away legs, I love you;  
      take away eyes, I love you;  
      no more body,  
      no more name,  
      no more "you":  
      I love you.

    You stand before my eyes  
    ten thousand feet away  
    and all I see  
    is that lover inside me.

    How can we be separate from ourselves?  
    Run!  Escape the perfection of God!  
    As I watch, to behold the impossible.
