    The waters are not blue,  
    but they are still.  
    And the whitish field outside  
    is still a living green in my memory.

    As I write you, I find

    That my sigh has grown forgiving,  
    and my heart, fond of quiet --

    For my mind has ceased living,  
    and in dying, now dreams.
