    The sands of the desert are calm and quiet.  
    A snake makes himself into a pen  
    and draws the longest letter I have ever seen.

    The lizards push against the rocks  
    up and down, up and down --  
    inmates of Hell's own fitness spa.

    The gila monster is still where I last saw him.  
    And above it all, the cactus, centuries old --  
      Old Man of the Desert --  
    yet an infant of the sands and rock.

    And me, with my pen.  
    What can I say?  
    I am always thirsty.
