Someone who has nothing gains at every turn; but someone who has too
much, always perceives that they are losing it.

> > Have little and you will gain.
>     Have much and you will be confused. (Lao Tzu)

Although in our culture humility and lowliness are seen to be "lesser"
than fame and accomplishment, actually humility is a more positive state
of being: because a man of great pride will tend to be taken down from
his high station much more often, while the humble man -- the lower he
is -- will always find himself lifted.

So the poorer you are in the moment, the richer you are in life.
