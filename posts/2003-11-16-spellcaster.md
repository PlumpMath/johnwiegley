    Silence. Cold thoughts.  
    The procession of phantoms in a dark world of dreams.  
    I am summoning memories, trying to reflect,  
    seeking understanding in the vapors and steams.

    The cauldron boils and demons writhe --  
    everything readies to pierce through the veil.  
    My thinking submits to the mysteries of old;  
    my consciousness cracks -- I am beyond the pale.

    Too late for memories of the world and its woes;  
    too late for hope and the sadness it knows.  
    The spell is unleashed and the time is at hand:  
    now witness the power I have at command!

    Choice at my left hand, Fate to my right;  
    I look at them both  
      and see the mysteries of night...
