    The wind one morning  
    carried Your voice to me;  
    but when I turned my head  
      it was gone.

    Looking up one night  
    a sparkling Light caught my eye;  
    but when I turned my head  
      it was gone.

    A fragrance on the breeze  
    enchanted both heart and mind;  
    but when I turned my head  
      it was gone.

    Until at last  
    the thought came to me:  
      Why do I keep turning away?
