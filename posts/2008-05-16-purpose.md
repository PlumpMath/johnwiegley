    Whenever I have thirsted  
    though my tongue sought water  
    my soul sought for this.

    Whenever I have yearned  
    though my dreams dreamt of futures  
    my soul dreamt of this.

    Whenever I have labored  
    though my efforts aimed higher  
    my soul aimed at this.

    Whenever I have swooned  
    though my heart longed for beauty  
    my soul longed for this.

    Experience is a gilt onion.  
    I peel it back, layer by layer,  
    and always I find this.

    This is the purpose.  
    This is the meaning.  
    This is the intent.

    Perhaps you wonder what I mean?  
    In truth, you wonder about this.
