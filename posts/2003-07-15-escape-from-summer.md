    Trees are aflame in a fire without heat.  
    Golden reds and crimson yellows climb through the branches.

    A kiss of temperate winds on the cheek.  
    A feel of soft grasses, and sounds muffled by leaves.

    The heat of summer days giving way.  
    Cool nights of bullfrogs and cricket songs.

    The moon, a shade of water's blue.  
    The starlight neither hazy, nor winter bright.
