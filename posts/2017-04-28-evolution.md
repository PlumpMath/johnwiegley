All things serve God's purpose, so it's quite possible that many of the
current theories on species development are valid. What Bahá'ís add is that,
in the final analysis, all things are seen to serve the greater plan of God:
the appearance of human perfections.

Viewed through the narrowing lens of time, any one thing appears quite
independent, a random movement of individual actors. But stepping back, we
believe a larger pattern emerges, one that has always, and will always,
reflect the will of God.

> If it is considered with insight, it will be seen that all the forces of the
  universe, in the last analysis serve the Covenant. -- ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
