    How many kind eyes  
    look out at the world?

    How much laughter  
    do we hear?

    How much courtesy  
    graces the name "humanity"?

    Today, we are one less.

    And outside my window,  
    where I used to see his truck,  
    the great arms of the loquat tree  
    have folded, and broken.

    Half of that tree lies silent now on the ground.

    It could no longer sustain  
    its burden of sorrow.
