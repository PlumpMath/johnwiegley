I ran across this quote today, which I like very much.  It is by
`Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the Founder of the Bahá'í Faith:

> ... that which is conducive to association and attraction and unity
> among the sons of men is the means of the life of the world of
> humanity, and whatever causeth division, repulsion and remoteness
> leadeth to the death of humankind.
