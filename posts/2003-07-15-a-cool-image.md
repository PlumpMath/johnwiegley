    The vapors rising off the ice:  
    a sublime landscape of winter:  
    arctic pieces of the sea trapped  
    in the white amber of millennia.

    The seals below bump their heads,  
    the bears in white coats rumble their hunger;  
    against the black night, the white fox howls  
    and the rabbit hears him in the echoes of sleep.
