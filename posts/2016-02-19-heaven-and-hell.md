    In Heaven,
    thirst is prized, for it
    reveals the flavor of water;
    and drinking is prized, as
    it unites one with the Source;
    and the Ocean is life:
    the Object of all desire.

    But in Hell,
    thirst is a torment, for
    it reveals what is lacking;
    and drinking is despised,
    since it cannot satisfy;
    and the Ocean is death
    to the lambent flame of desire.
