    When the smell of rain  
    is fuller than the rain itself...

    When one drops fall  
    and then a thousand;  
    when the first bolt  
    divides the sky;  
    when a clap resounds  
    like the Hands of God;  
    and the water on your lips  
    fell from Heaven...

    After the fury and the darkness  
    will shine every color  
    that eyes can see.
