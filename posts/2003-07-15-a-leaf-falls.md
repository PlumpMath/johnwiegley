    A leaf falls into the river,  
    swept away --  
    entreaties are useless --  
    the swift beat of time  
    marked in nearing the sea.  
    Turning and turning,  
    jade green on the dark green below,  
    and then nothing...

    Just the river, and the tree  
    and my memory  
    to count the loss.
