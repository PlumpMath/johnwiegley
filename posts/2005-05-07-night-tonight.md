    Night, tonight  
      fair black on  
        drops of starling white;  
    a dreamer's sea  
      for finer sails  
        O captains of the light!  
    onward ho,  
      to heaven's hold  
        where angels take their flight  
    and join the  
      twirl of galaxies  
        who dance upon such heights.
