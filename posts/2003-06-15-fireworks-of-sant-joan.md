    At one moment, it is too quiet.  
    Expectation remakes the stillness  
    into a sharp knife  
    cutting away at the future...

    Then a tiny puff of sound,  
    the tension climbing in pace  
    with some unseen shape  
    that waiting eyes see too well...

    Then too fierce for the one moment!  
    whose gentle, pausing silence  
    is ripped into a flash of color  
    as a wound from some bright being  
    hiding in the blackened clouds  
    until...  
    that one moment of sound and flash.

    And now the embers of a heavenly fire  
    drift slowly back to earth.
