    Wan sun is all that fills  
    the somber arch of the sky;  
    one Eye, closing in restful contemplation  
    of the denizens below;  
    one minute, before its last ray  
    jousts the sky, to be no more;  
    one instant -- a pause of fading day --  
    before acquiescing to enter the night.
