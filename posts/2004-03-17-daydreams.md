    The deer in the park  
    watch me with curiosity.  
    What mysteries of life have I found?  
    Do I know the way  
    to the ever-green grass?

    With the breeze, they fade away --  
    only daydreams --  
    and I look to memory:

    Home in Virginia, the summer fields,  
    winter meadows,  
    spring brooks...

    Enough years I've lived  
    to know them all many times.

    But the ever-green grass  
    I have yet to find.  
    Only in daydreams,  
    seeming a little greener each year.
