This past weekend I went on a camping trip with my brother, my
sister-in-law, and several of their friends.  While there I was able to
[take some pictures](gallery/Oregon/Lake%20Crescent/index.html), which reveal some of the beauty of that area.  It's
a bit like a different place, so empty, so much nature.  I spent much of
my time lazing around, reading from "Walden", and of course, taking
walks with my camera.
