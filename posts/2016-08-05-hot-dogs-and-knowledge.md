A quick analogy occurred to me concerning the different between Ilm and
Irf√°n, that is, between acquired knowledge and the deep understanding of a
thing.

The former is reading that animals are treated poorly, and that hot dogs are
made of terrible things, yet it doesn't stop you from enjoying them. The
latter is visiting the factory, and then the treatment plants, and having your
appetite forever removed by that knowledge, by an awareness you can't unknow.
