    The city is strung with lights,  
    pearls of white, yellow,  
    glowing brilliantly  
    as the sun sinks  
    in the western hills.

    Lying on my side,  
    watching the city fall to sleep,  
    my thoughts wander across the ocean,  
    wondering if your smiling eyes  
    wouldn't dazzle me the more.
