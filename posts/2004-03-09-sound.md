    The blue thumbprints of an artist's proof,  
    labelled on white spheres of alabaster  
    deep set into a skull of ash  
    baked in a stone oven.

    Befriend the troubled -- his last ray of hope  
    as a blooded sun casts shadows  
    on the pitiless hearts of those  
    who would call him nothing.

    Terrified, lonely, consorting with demons  
    that abide ever between heart and mind,  
    all waiting to lead unwary souls to  
    the yawning gates of perdition.
