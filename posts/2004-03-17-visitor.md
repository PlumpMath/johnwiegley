    Some only sit by  
    to observe, to question,  
    but not to delve.

    But when those others come --  
    the night is filled with dancing.

    After candles go to sleep,  
    and the sky shows its rainbow,  
    I awake.

    I'd forgotten the day, and who I was.  
    A soul'd come to visit me.
