I live in a part of the world where I can mostly take freedom for granted.
And I think it fair to say that this is how it should be, everywhere.  As I
read the speeches of the Romans and the Greeks, I see how much they loved the
idea, and the promise, of freedom.  The framework of America builds on this
message of hope, believing that the souls thrive best when they have room to
go.  I think even that some American teenagers wouldn't believe that freedom
barely exists in some parts of the world.  It's the twenty-first century after
all; wasn't that all a thing of the past?

But for many, the lack of basic freedoms -- even something as primary as one's
belief in God -- still prevails to this generation.  Case in point are my
fellow Bahá'ís in the Middle East and thereabouts.  My wife's family fled
persecution to become refugees.  Can you believe she couldn't even pursue a
medical school education while living in her own country? [^1]

Sadly, such persecutions are as fresh as the past two weeks.  It seems that
the Yemenese government has detained a Bahá'í family for deporation back to
Iran, the very country and government they left in hope of greater freedoms
elsewhere.  You can [read the news article here][].  Nor is this all that
remote of an incident, since one of the people being deported is the father of
my aunt's friend.

I'm posting this notice to get the word out there, since many citizens of
these governments simply don't know what's going on.  Their media just doesn't
report it.  But we who live in the land of freedom can.
