After much thought, and letters from encouraging friends, I've decided
to continue with this website.  I found it helpful for me to have it
running, because it stimulated me to write.

Everything on this site is written by me, whatever others may claim.  No
one else's work is presented here, without giving them full credit as
the author.  Also, all material is under copyright, and should not be
published elsewhere without obtaining permission.  Thank you!
