    Leave me to sit by the rutilant flames,  
    mesmerized  
    having lost every opportunity of success in your world.

    And with my dying breath I shall blow a kiss  
    that no one will understand;  
    for my last breath is gone now,  
    and why?

    Having made "nothing" of myself,  
    I am invisible to you.
