    I am fond of the sun.  
    It reaches rays of light around me  
    and gives the warmest hugs;  
    it beams at me with smiles  
    that light my world;  
    it leaves me each day,  
    to my quiet thoughts,  
    but returns to wake me in the morning.  
    What lover's know --  
    perhaps they learn from the sun.
