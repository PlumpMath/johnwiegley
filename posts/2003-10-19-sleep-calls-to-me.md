    Although sleep calls to me with a sweet voice,  
    I cannot answer.  
    To close my eyes, and weep soft tears with Her  
      in form of dreams  
    would need a readiness to awaken  
    I cannot master.

    Tease me not, my Love,  
    by your soft caresses  
    in shape of pillows and thread.  
    I know the land you call me to:  
    is it not for mortals to tread?

    My eyes close gently now  
    on world and wondering both;  
    perhaps these words, from a pensive heart,  
    may find you, and keep you,  
    and bind you to me in troth.
