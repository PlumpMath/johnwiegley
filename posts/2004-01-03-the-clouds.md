    Do the clouds above  
    feel emptied when the sun leaves?  
    casting pale shadows  
    of their pallid selves  
    along the moonlit ground...

    What shape of sorrow  
    steals across their misty brow?  
    Loosing one tear  
    and then a thousand  
    upon a silence too profound.
