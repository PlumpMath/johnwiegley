This world is joined to another, in the way that these words are joined to the
meaning behind them; and like these words, if you cannot read them, or do not
know the language or the concepts, you cannot access that world. Both stem
from the author's mind, while the words themselves are only pigment. A mystic
strives to learn the divine language, so he may read the book of the world and
apprehend its meaning; otherwise, it is only atoms and coincidences.
