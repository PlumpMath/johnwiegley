    There are times when I come to You in prayer,  
    and feel like a beggar, hoping for salvation.  
    Other days, I am a merchant, bargaining for my soul.

    I have been a philosopher, musing on death;  
    and a coward, praying for more life.

    Each time I bow my head,  
    I wear a different costume,  
    and a different name to my profession.

    But today, I long to feel none of these.  
    I wish only to come to You in prayer,  
    and find no one else in attendance.
