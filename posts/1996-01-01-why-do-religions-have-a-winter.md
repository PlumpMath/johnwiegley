Why is it that every Dispensation has a winter?  A time when the
fortunes of the Faith have reached their fullest consummation, and it
nows begins to decline into the mire of orthodoxy and excessive
dogmatism?

Perhaps because religion is not about belief in God, but love of God.
If religion were never to decline, but rather reach a pinnacle from
which it never receded, then belief would be easy, and who would believe
that such belief was not synonymous with true love?  The Faith declines
that it may be renewed, so that in each age there are reasons for people
to wonder Who God truly is, rather than merely accept what has come to
be regarded as unquestionably true.
