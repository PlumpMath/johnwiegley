title: Does God need our prayers?

A flower opens its petals and prays to the sun, not because the sun needs it.

The sere grass is grateful for a falling rain, not because the clouds need it.

If we understood the nature of our soulâ€™s relationship to God, prayer,
reverence and gratitude would never feel forced upon us. They are the natural
order of things, once one takes into account the spiritual world. Perhaps they
are required of us at the beginning so we can derive some benefit from them,
before having understood.
