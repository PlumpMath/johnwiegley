    How powerful,  
    this pen in my hand;  
    capable of reshaping the world.

    By itself,  
    lonely and impotent.

    But if the will of an intent mind  
    wields it with intention,  
    its sharp point  
    begins to shine into the future,  
    like a laser pointing out  
    the form of tomorrow.
