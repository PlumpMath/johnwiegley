    Ah, true, sleepless one,  
    I will ever write;  
    it is only a question,  
    should ears hear?  
    or the river Tigris  
    swallow the black tears  
    that runs in drops of ink  
    along these pages...

    Perhaps I feel echoes  
    of that joy Bahá'u'lláh  
    had known  
    writing for His heart's Revelation  
    but knowing none could hear.

    I possess no capacities as such  
    yet every being  
    is a symbol created  
    by the accents of His voice.
