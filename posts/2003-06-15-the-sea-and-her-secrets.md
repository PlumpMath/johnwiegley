    Here is a chest whose lid we cannot grasp  
    that needs no lock  
    that rubs out the messages  
    we send her on the sand.

    Even the sun cannot fathom her.  
    Whole regions of permanent night,  
    a wet fist clasping  
    the very whole of Earth...

    The deeps that lie beneath  
    are not for you and me.  
    The pearls that gather eternally there  
    will ever remain the secrets of the sea.
