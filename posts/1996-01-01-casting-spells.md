"spell" in Old English meant "speak", and casting a spell means speaking
words of power such that they invoke something.  How is that different
from prayer?  A prayer as an invocation of the Holy Spirit, that it come
down and affect the lives of the people, and the world.  It's the only
truly evident power.  Teaching and transformation can only occur through
its grace.  Therefore, a wizard is simply someone who has the faith to
cast these spells, and invoke the Holy Spirit.
