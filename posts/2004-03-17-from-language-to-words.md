    I wish I had a switch  
    that would make English  
    a foreign language to me.

    Then I could watch the faces of people,  
    bobbing up and down,  
    and listen to the music of their voices:

    The soft tones, mixed with  
    rich, lustry cooing;  
    or the staccato whisper of a hushed conversation.

    And everything else:  
    the complaints, rumors, gossip,  
    and talk of this world;

    would transform again into something innocent  
    and quite uniquely beautiful.
