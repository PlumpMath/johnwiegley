    Nighttime -- a quiet footstep.  
    Through the rustling grass I see her amber skin,  
    and my heart forgets the world...

    When I remembered to write again,  
    it was too late.

    Her lips had whispered in my ears,  
    but what they said...

    It would need a kiss to tell it again.
