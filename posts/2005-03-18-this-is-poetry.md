    Sometimes, only poems will do.

    The words as they meet the paper  
    sing with a subtle voice,  
    a quiet, ringing tone  
    that resounds in the heart:  
    this is poetry.

    So I lift my pen, my wand  
    and conjure fair spells  
    to entrance the heart  
    and grant the power to fly...

    Poetry is a doorway to impossible lands.
