Location: Manijeh's house, Gilbert, Arizona

    Sunlight  
    where do you go?  
    I know that at dusk  
    you make the mountains glow.  
    Your last ray catches my eye  
    but I wonder:  
    why must you go?  
    Why leave me to the dark of night?  
    To the cold,  
    to the bitter hours...  
    The moon's a poor reflection;  
    the stars, a distant company.  
    Is my only hope to wait?  
    To trust we'll meet again?  
    My dear sunlight  
    where did you go?
