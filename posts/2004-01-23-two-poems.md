title: Two poems
tags: journal

Not many thoughts recently -- life has been very full.  But at least a
couple of poems: [letter to the watchman](letter.to.watchman), a reference to a Bahá'í story
from [The Seven Valleys) (my favorite of all books](http://www.bahai-library.com/writings/bahaullah/sv/700.html); and
[tales I tell myself](tales.i.tell.myself), just some errant musing.
