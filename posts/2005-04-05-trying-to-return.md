    I was a fish  
    of the vasty deep.  
    Alone on beds  
    of coral and pearl  
    I used to take my sleep.

    Until one day  
    I climbed up high  
    and filled my lungs with air --  
    now I cannot dive at all  
    except into despair.

    I prayed to God,  
    "Assist my way!  
    I long to know Your depths --  
    if only for this bulb of air  
    this curs√®d gasp of breath."

    How can nothing  
    keep me from Something?  
    This air inside me  
      is not me  
    but binds me just as well.

    So God answered  
    and poked me good  
    to save me from my hell.
