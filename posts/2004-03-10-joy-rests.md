    In a pause, to remember my life,  
    It seems such a crazy jumble of nothing  
    Headed inexplicably toward what must be something.

    And the daydreams -- those glances of light --  
    Are my hope of what Joy might be when it finally finishes resting.

    "I've had my heart broken until now,"  
    I say to that far-away girl of my dreams,  
    "Do you know what it'll take to fix it?"

    "No, what?", she says,  
    Her eyes alive with the future.

    "Oh, nothing," I say,  
    "Just that you're there to see me through it."
