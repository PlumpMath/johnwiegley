    He lays fallen upon the ground,  
    victim to a battle  
    more die for with every day;  
    his worth spent,  
    the fiber of his head  
    clouded by moody pensations;  
    a collar of white,  
    crown of dusty gold  
    crushed flat  
    by the heel that cast him aside;  
    and lacking now the breath  
    that summoned his end  
    to tell of his humble plight --  
    he must ever remain unsung:  
    a cigarette butt.
