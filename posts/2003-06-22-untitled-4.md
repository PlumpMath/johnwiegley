Here's a Catalan breakfast for you to try:

1. Slice Caprese bread into half-inch thick slices.
1. Slice a ripe tomato in half.
1. Smash the tomato, flat-side down, into the bread.
1. Pour a little olive oil on the bread.
1. Add a sprinkling of salt.

This is a favorite that people eat before meals!
