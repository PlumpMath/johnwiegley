    I have waited so long for a companion,  
    with whom, hand in hand,  
    we could sit by the ocean  
    and unravel the experiences we've each had with life --

    Not our everyday encounters,  
    but real life

    Come!  Come!  Be with me.

    I want to hear our voices carry us  
    into the darkest recesses of the night.
