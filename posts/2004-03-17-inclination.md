    Poetry, music, or art  
    is something we use to equate  
    ourselves with a greater beauty outside.

    In the falling leaves of autumn,  
    or the raindrops that lie with sadness on the ground,

    We behold something in nature --  
    isolated for a single moment by our attention --  
    that draws out from our hearts  
    an impulse toward something greater.
