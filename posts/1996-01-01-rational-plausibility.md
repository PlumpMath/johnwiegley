Rational plausibility is a hermenuetical technique of interpreting
religious scripture by inventing a scheme whereby the madness of it
seems less mad.  This means inventing a metaphor, or analogy or
argument, that simply shows that the thought is conceivable in some
contact -- however fictional -- and thus points the road to further
elucidation.  If anything, it is a way of at least palliating the mind,
to give the soul a chance to feel, and might exchange inspiration for
sheer consternation.  In this sense, it is not a tool for furthering
understanding, so much as it is a technique for discovering moments of
spiritual upliftment, which may often be themselves the real key to
understanding.
