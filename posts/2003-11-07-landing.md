    Landing after so long a flight  
    turning on the hot water  
    washing the stains of travel...

    The bed welcomes like a lover,  
    the clean sheets embrace me,  
    the pillow's constant touch is a kiss.

    I left another continent tonight,  
    adding its fair memories  
    to the book of my heart's history.
