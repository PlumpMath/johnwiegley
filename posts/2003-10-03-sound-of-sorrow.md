    Is the sound of sorrow  
    limited, like a voice's cry?

    Or does the soul's suspiration  
    heed no boundaries of space or time?

    The winds of late have seemed  
    to hold a deeper tone;

    More than just the capping of waves  
    along the rolling blue.

    Was that your soft weeping I heard?  
    or were those salty drops the ocean's own...
