    Pain is the zest of life  
    and joy  
    the sweetness of the fruit within.

    Whoever's bite is too shallow  
    and shrinks back  
    from the bitter, pungent  
    necessity of contact

    Never tastes the full bite,  
    as teeth sink deep  
    into a flesh designed  
    to discourage the casual nibbler.

    But if he go  
    just that little bit further  
    what a supple, succulent juice  
    is his reward;

    An ambrosia  
    for those whose knowledge  
    will not permit  
    stopping at the first taste.
