    I see you wearing ringlets, in a pretty dress;  
    your skirt is more the shape than the cloth.  
    And your tiny blouse expertly contains  
    what my longing wishes free...

    You are beautiful, my dear -- let none say otherwise.  
    I write you poems, but it's not enough;  
    I would rather feel your curves  
    than this smooth, white paper under my fingers.
