    Seek truth where it may be found:  
    No one asks if the sun is shining;  
    no one ponders if the band still plays;  
    no one questions the firmness of the ground.

    Plato's company shuffled from the cave,  
    and found the fact of light is blinding.  
    To a thirsty man, water is the proof;  
    to the hungry, food is their book of Revelation.

    Not theories can warm the coldness of the night;  
    brilliant thoughts won't compete with a single Ray.  
    Ask the lover for this or that proof --  
    he will bleed to show you the way.
