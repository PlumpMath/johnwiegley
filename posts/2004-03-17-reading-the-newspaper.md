    Ahead of me faced a long hall  
    seemingly dedicated to blackness.  
    From either side, through closed doors,  
    I heard screams and tired sighs;  
    moans that betrayed an impatient anguish  
    and a longing for an end to life.

    Nearby, someone tapped me on the shoulder,  
    causing me to look up from my newspaper.
