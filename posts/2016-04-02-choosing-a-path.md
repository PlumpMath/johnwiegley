How do we choose a "Way" to follow?  We have to ascertain whether someone is
qualified to give us Laws, and then follow them.  A child can't judge by
himself which of his parent's rules are necessary and which aren't.  Trying to
assess the words of the Prophets this way leads to endless arguments.

Likewise, a patient does not find a good doctor by seeking the "correct
prescription" for his illness.  Only a doctor can know that.  Instead, we
look for the signs of skill and experience which distinguish a good doctor, and
put ourselves in his hands.
