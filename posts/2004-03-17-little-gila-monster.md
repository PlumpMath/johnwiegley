    Little Gila monster!  
    Reaching over those pebbles must be hard.  
    Your back, yellow like a hundred bees at rest,  
    twists left and right, left and right,  
    gathering strength to conquer those pebbles once again.

    Without haste you waddle home,  
    a foot here, a foot there,  
    until the desert stones alone  
    remember your passage.
