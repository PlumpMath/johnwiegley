After all I'd written and thought, an ironic moment: Yesterday, after a
very good friend did practically nothing, I reacted as though it were
very much something, getting quite upset in the process.  Which today
makes me wonder at how habituated I can be at building castles from
thought, to trap my soul within their fragile dimensions.  It is so easy
to turn aside from the moment, to gaze down the halls of fantasy.  Why?
To what end?  For what attraction?  The irony of my own life is perhaps
the best place to look for wisdom...
