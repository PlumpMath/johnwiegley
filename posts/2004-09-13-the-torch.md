    I feel upon my heart  
    a sacred fire.  
    It consumes me;  
    I am its fuel.

    Slowly, it turns a thing  
    of oil and wood  
    into light and warming heat.  
    I am the mystery of transformation.

    I am now a beacon in the dark,  
    a torch in the hand of the Divine.

    Look not at the black pitch  
    of my heart,  
    it is needed for the flames.

    Consenting to burn,  
    I find meaning  
    in each of my wooden imperfections.

    Now the anguish is upon me;  
    the darkness scatters at my touch.

    I burn to nothing,  
    casting light on all around me:  
    I burn to illumine.

    I may be only a rod of wood,  
    but what I reveal  
    is beyond compare.
