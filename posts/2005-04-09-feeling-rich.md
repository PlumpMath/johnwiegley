title: Feeling rich

    Colors, like purple;
    sounds, like a lover's whisper;
    lazy Sundays in the city,
    or any day in the country.

    Evenings like this one:
    soft breezes that play in the flower bed,
    a lonely cat, crying for a friend,
    and my thoughts, seeking your memory...
