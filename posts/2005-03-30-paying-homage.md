    See how the wild daisy  
    bows in the wind?  
    But what does it make  
    obeisance to?

    To you, looking on,  
    it pays homage  
    to nothing at all.

    So come closer --  
    still closer --  
    until you too  
    feel the breath of Wind  
    on your face.

    Only then can you know  
    whether that flower  
    is a wise one  
    or a fool.
