I think real certitude is the product of assiduously striving to gain a
deeper understanding of life, and a faith in God thereby.  And as we
begin to live and move in a different sphere, our certainty in the
reality of that sphere -- and the consequent nothingness of this
ephemeral plane -- begins to become so obvious that we really can't see
it any other way.  In that sense, if another person were to assail us
with questions and doubts, we would think, "But how could life possibly
be less than beautiful, when the true reality of things touches me every
day?"  From that comes the true heart certainty: of having known faith
directly, through concrete experience and development.
