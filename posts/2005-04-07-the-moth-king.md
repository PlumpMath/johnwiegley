    Behold!  
    I am the Moth Satan  
    wreathed in flame.

    I glow with a heat  
    only lovers  
    can comprehend.

    My scepter  
    is my burning limbs;  
    my crown,  
    my blazing brow;  
    my throne,  
    the torment  
    that surrounds me...

    Behold!  
    I am the Moth Angel --  
    for fire and love  
    have made me king.
