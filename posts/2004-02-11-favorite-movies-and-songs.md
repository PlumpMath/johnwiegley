Wrote up a [list of my favorite movies](GoodMovies).  If you have recommendations for
ones I may have missed, please send me an e-mail (see "Send comments"
link in the sidebar).

I've also put up my [playlist of favorite songs](playlist).

And one more favorite, a verse from the play *Agamemnon*:

    Let good prevail!  So be it!  
    Yet, what is good?  And who  
    Is God?  How name him, and speak true?  
    If he accept the name that men  
    Give him, Zeus I name him then.  
    I, still perplexed in mind,  
    For long have searched and weighed  
    Every hope of comfort or of aid:  
    Still I can find  
    No creed to lift this heaviness,  
    This fear that haunts without excuse --  
    No name inviting faith, no wistful guess,  
    Save only -- Zeus.
