    A calm wind rises up,  
    carrying rose petals in a lazy spiral,  
    touching you in places  
    too intimate for words to picture.

    Are my thoughts that wind?  
    and fond memories the roses  
    that shed petals in long sighs  
    of remembrance, adoration and longing?

    The image is frail glass, blown gossamer  
    over a canvas of gentle nature;  
    let no words intrude -- lest the silence break  
    and shatter the peace in a weeping of broken glass.
