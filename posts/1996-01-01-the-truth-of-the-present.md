The only truth we encounter is the present, and the words of the
prophets.  Because the past we remember inaccurately, and our
conceptions of the future are uncertain.  And all of our abstractions
about reality are incomplete.  Although we may not understand the truth
that is presented, that is the form in which it presents itself to us.
