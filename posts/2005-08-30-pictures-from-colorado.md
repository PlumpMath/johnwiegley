The other day I had a chance to go hiking with my father at the Seven
Falls park in Colorado Springs.  There are several photographs from the
hike we took [here](gallery/Colorado/Seven%20Falls/index.html).  And no, there are no people in the pictures!  As a
few have noticed, my artistic side resonates more with the idea of an
empty landscape.
