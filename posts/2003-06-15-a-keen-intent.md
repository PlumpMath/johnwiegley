    The movements of a train  
    over long rails  
    of hardened purpose  
    a pair of arrows  
    forever flying sure  
    the cold steel  
    impervious to distraction.

    The movements of a train  
    upon the iron rails  
    without which  
    the purpose of even  
    the finest engine  
    would remain unknown:  
    a being without  
    the will to move.
