    When time is fullest  
    it loses all meaning.  
    The hours go by in a moment  
    and every minute  
    is remembered as an hour.  
    It passes faster than notice,  
    and endures longer than possible.

    Only when time is regular  
    every hour counting for an hour --  
    ourselves fully conscious of each --  
    does it bear any relation  
    to the passing of our lives.
