    I watched a mime  
    think he could paint the sky with his touch;  
    his hands, dipped in white paint,  
    drawing strokes that left no imprint.

    Unless it was not the air  
    he meant to reach,  
    and his canvas  
    not the emptiness around him...

    But the eyes of his watchers,  
    their little easels of hearts  
    capturing each vanishing motion  
    in the fondness of memory.
