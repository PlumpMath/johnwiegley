    A tender suffering, you once taught me --  
    your eyes the lesson, your smile the book;

    It was a tale unlike the songs of heaven  
    that the choir boys whisper in their nook;

    Of sweet death you then instructed me,  
    and the truth of longing's demise:

    That to love another One so deeply  
    is a pain only union can deny...
