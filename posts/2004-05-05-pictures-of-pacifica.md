Finally! I can show some images of my home town, Pacifica, California
(which is about four miles south from the city of San Francisco).  I've
done web searches before to find images of Pacifica, but couldn't turn
up much.  So here is [my own gallery](gallery/California/Pacifica/index.html), with a few pictures from the part
of town where I live.

Also, these photos represent another stage in my camera education: Most
of them were taken in aperture priority mode, where I was able to
manually control the depth of field.  I then transferred the RAW images
into Photoshop CS, and played around with the white balance, color
curves, lighting levels, used the healing brush, etc.  I am addicted to
that program already! and have found it very easy to turn marginal
photos into just what I was looking for.

I have also winnowed the collection of Aptos pictures to my true
favorites, and added [another set of photos](gallery/California/Scotts%20Valley/index.html) from a picnic this past
weekend in Scotts Valley (a town about one hour to the south).
