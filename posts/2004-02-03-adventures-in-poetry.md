I have been thinking about poetry recently, and how the experience of
writing it has changed for me over the years.  These thoughts are
condensed in a brief essay: [Adventures in Poetry](adventures.poetry).

    I lift my pen, my wand  
    and conjure fair spells  
    to entrance the heart,  
    granting it power to fly...

    Love is a doorway to impossible lands.
