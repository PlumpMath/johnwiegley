    Remind me of that time  
    when the brilliance of dreaming  
    was the color of a sunrise;

    When the rippling waters of Glacier Lake  
    and the waves of blue  
    that gathered at my toes

    Were exactly what my heart desired,  
    on a warm day,  
    beneath the pale clouds of a lazy summer.
