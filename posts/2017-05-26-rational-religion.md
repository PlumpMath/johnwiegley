We naturally want religion to be rational, easily comprehended, and defensible
before all arguments, but it has never been so. Some aspects of God's Will are
deeply shrouded in mystery, and will remain forever beyond our ken.

    How can feeble reason encompass the Qur’án,
    Or the spider snare a phoenix in his web?
    Wouldst thou that the mind should not entrap thee?
    Teach it the science of the love of God!

If reason is to be the highest goal, one must abandon what is beyond reason;
but if one long for the Object of his heart's desire, love is the only pathway
to that region. The mind is a noble and trustworthy steed, but it should not
mount the rider. Look beyond the outward forms and incongruities and ask: is
there a deeper unity within?
