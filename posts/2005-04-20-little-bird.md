    I think perhaps  
    your heart is a little bird,  
    longing to beat its wings  
    in the high places,  
    to sing and sing  
    until Song itself says, "Enough!"

    I sit near you  
    and hear the flapping  
    of those tiny wings...  
    Your body seems to float away.  
    If you ran with all your might  
    you couldn't catch up  
    with that eager heart.

    You are a creature of spirit  
    living here for a short while;  
    don't ever imagine  
    the bars on your cage  
    are a part of who you are.

    Fly on, little bird:  
    fly on -- until flight becomes you.
