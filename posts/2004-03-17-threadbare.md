    My connection to the world  
    is narrowing like a spindle's thread,  
    turning over and over in my mind  
    until its width is but a hair.

    However, though much thinner,  
    it is now far stronger,  
    more cohesive,  
    than its loosely made beginning:  
    a chaotic piece of wool.
