    Should the moon settle on the waters  
    appearing bright among the waves,  
    and lead the mind to tranquil thoughts  
    of earlier times, and younger days,

    Remind the heart: it's still free yet:  
    there's nothing lost that's not been gained;  
    it's simply how we look on things  
    that sometimes feels restrained.
