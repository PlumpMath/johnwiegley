    Fear not, little seed.

    The Farmer has destined
    all good things for you:
    A warm sun,
    furry friends,
    a refreshing breeze.

    With what wisdom!
    He thrust you into a hole,
    pitch and dark;
    airless, lightless;
    every movement a struggle.
    A world, in every way opposite.

    Never cease reaching
    toward the sky you were promised.
    Fear not, little seed,
    Fear not.
