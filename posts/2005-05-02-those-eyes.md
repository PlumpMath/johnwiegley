    Young Leyla,  
    with bright eyes  
    like stars from another heaven.  
    You guide this lonely mariner,  
    his ship twice-wrecked  
    against life's tormented seas.  
    For now I have  
    new hopes to lift me:  
    that elsewhere in love's firmament  
    there might be other eyes  
    like these.
