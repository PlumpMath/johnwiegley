Location: 239 Misty Creek Drive

    Only the soft rains do I hear...  
    The sheets of water on my back;  
    the thunder and wind.

    For all of the noise  
    there is the deepest silence.  
    My footfalls are a clamor.

    I walk the shores  
    of a swollen river,  
    the nighttime at my back.
