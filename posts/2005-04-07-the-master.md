    When the Master appears  
    is a time  
    for questions and answers:  
      Your questions,  
      His answers.

    Do not presume  
    to know in His presence;  
    do not even imagine  
    you know what Knowledge is.

    Bow to your Sensei!!

    If he says you're hungry,  
    feel your stomach growl;  
    let His words  
    become your reality.

    As long as you consider Him  
    with your eyes  
    you see a feeble man;

    As long as He looks at you  
    with His  
    He gives His counsel.
