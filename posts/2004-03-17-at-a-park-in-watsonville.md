    Don Juan Matus!

    You call us from our everyday thoughts:  
    and we puzzle over bird-calls  
    and candle-lights flickering.

    Each time we summon up  
    the mundane task  
    that brought us to your door,

    We are plunged back into the mists again,  
    musing on the solitary flights of Venus...
