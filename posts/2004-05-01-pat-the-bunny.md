Today I took the plunge and bought a camera (digital) for the first time
in my life.  The only other time I was able to take pictures for myself
was back in pre-adolescence, when my mother gave me her old 110
telephoto -- that soon afterward broke.  I have never been a big fan of
photography, preferring to record images in my head than transfer them
to film.  But one interesting point was made in a website I found: about
the fact that looking for a good picture can sensitize you to the
aesthetics of your environment, just as in the difference between
hearing good music, and listening to it to find its unique beauty.
We'll see if that comes true.  Until then, one of my first pictures: a
long-time programming and traveling pal, Pat the Bunny.
