    All of these colors  
    these riots of sound  
    this salt on my tongue  
    the cotton breeze  
    the air of budding spring...

    Titillate something  
    apart from these.  
    Some place  
    without color or shape,  
    a being made known  
    when all other movement  
    comes to rest:

    The silent life.
