    I know the feel of the midnight wind;  
    I know the touch of another's soul.  
    Both pass over, moving, changing  
    and feeding the fire within.

    At once soft and profound,  
    silent and symphonous --  
    our wordless exchanges  
    touch eye and brow and heart with meaning.

    Yesterday became what it should have been.  
    And now, the present forming between us --  
    I wonder if that late-night spent  
    was not the future as it ought to be.
