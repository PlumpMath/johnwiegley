    There are doves who cry  
    a mournful sadness  
    when day has fled.

    They join the wolves  
    who bay  
    at the rising of the moon.

    Each twilight  
    is lonely for its sun,  
    faded and gone  
    behind clouds of red;

    I wonder at  
    nights like these:  
    how it all became  
    so somber, so soon.
