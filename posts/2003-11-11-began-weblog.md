Began a weblog today for the purpose of publishing poems and essays as
they are written.  The rest of the pages are still being converted, so
the links above will take you to the old content.

# Journal from the summer

A journal of my trips this summer to Spain and Italy has been compiled
into a book titled *A Time Abroad*.  So far, I have little idea on how
this would get published, but if you are interested it can be downloaded
as a [PDF file](pdf/summer2003.pdf).
