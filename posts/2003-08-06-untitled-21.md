    It can all be said  in one word  if our hearts share  the  
    vocabulary.

    But even then,  
    it's not to be said --  
    better if shown --  
    the nights themselves  
    will tell the meaning.

Perhaps I overwhelm the readers, since these days I write for my own
joy.  Should I end it?  If you, too, haven't the will to follow, I doubt
anyone else does.
