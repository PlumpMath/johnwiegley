    It can all be said  in one word  if our hearts share  the
    vocabulary.

    better if shown --
    the nights themselves
    will tell the meaning.

Perhaps I overwhelm the readers, since these days I write for my own
joy.  Should I end it?  If you, too, haven't the will to follow, I doubt
anyone else does.
