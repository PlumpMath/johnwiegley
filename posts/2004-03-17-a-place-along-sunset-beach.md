    Where the ever-deepening silence  
    collects into quiet pools of sound,  
    and the waves of light  
    issuing from far-off beacons  
    touch my fingertips as I lift them to my face,

    I understand that here is  
    a holy place,  
    where holy thoughts, and holy deeds,  
    have made sacred  
    a once ordinary ground.
