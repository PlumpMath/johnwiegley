    The moon lives up there,  
      so far away,  
        so detached,  
          so disinterested.

    I imagine it has no connection with us,  
    the living.

    And then I think:  
      there are so many poems written,  
        so many songs,  
          hearts inspired,  
            minds turned thoughtful...

    Looking from where I stand  
    it seems so very far away;  
    But reflecting more deeply:  
    it is more involved with life than I am.
