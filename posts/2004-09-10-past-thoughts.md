Before the advent of blogging, I used to jot my thoughts on paper in
composition books.  I've finally gathered these past entries together
into a kind of [historical blog](early).  It may have nothing more than
sentimental value, but it's there if anyone is interested.  The entries
range from 1997 until 2003, although since I no longer know the actual
dates, none are given.
