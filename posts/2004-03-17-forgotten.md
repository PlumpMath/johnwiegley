    The paper was pure white,  
    and then I scribbled over it.  
    Was it worthwhile?  
    Was my impact on life sufficient?

    I think my death should be simple, invisible,  
    and my tombstone free of words --  
    so that only my actions remain.

    The thought that troubles me is this:  
    will such special ink  
    be strong enough to preserve my memory?
