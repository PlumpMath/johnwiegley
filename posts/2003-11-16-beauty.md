    If I speak of sadness and sorrowful weeping,  
    lachrymose wandering,  
    clutching at my heart --  
    perhaps I refer to the beauty of its reality.

    Or loneliness.  Although empty beyond thought,  
    vacant like the winter, without warmth,  
    a terrible disease of struggling --  
    yet is it a real thing, an honest thing.

    Such purities burn away  
    the heavy sackcloth  
    that hides the face of beauty.
