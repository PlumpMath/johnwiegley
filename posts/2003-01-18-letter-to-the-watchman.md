    Your love is so very hard, my friend --  
    and so very dear.

    Icicles that rain on my heart  
    offer a cool draught  
    once the sun of knowing rises;

    Bitter grains of salt  
    make finely piquant  
    the dishes life sends after;

    Harsh fire -- a great inferno --  
    transfigures my iron soul  
    into radiant shafts of light...

    So very hard, my friend,  
    yet so dear.
