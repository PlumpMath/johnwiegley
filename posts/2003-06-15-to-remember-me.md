    If you stray along sandy beaches  
    throw a stone, to remember me.  
    The sun is shining without a sound;  
    the waves, the birds, are louder;  
    the salty air, sails in the far blue, all nearer;  
    yet not one thing as bright.  
    If your foot catches on a stone  
    throw it, to remember me.
