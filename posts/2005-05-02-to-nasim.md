    O Nasim!  
    gentle breeze of the Merciful  
    delight to eye and mind  
    beauteous form of intellect  
    a sharp arrow  
    flying through the fields of hearts...  
    You've trapped me.  
    I think of you often now.  
    When will I feel your breezes again  
    to lift this building heat  
    O Nasim?
