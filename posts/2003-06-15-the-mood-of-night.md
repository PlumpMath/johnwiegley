    A mood of night  
    settles on the trees,  
    on the satin of dark waters,  
    on the rocks and the creatures  
    of the watery deep.

    The moon is a bold eye  
    watching the land of evening;  
    sewing by his regard  
    tiny pearl-drops of light  
    that tempt the oyster's envy.

    And in the far-off, apace:  
    an isle of moonlight  
    drifts beneath the silent glow,  
    a carpet of lambent silver  
    against the mood of night.
