    Today they have all left me:  
    the everyday words we use with one another,  
    the everyday thoughts---the worries forever.

    I can feel the dreams inside me  
    struggling to find their way,

    Looking for the words to write  
    that will brush the clouds from the sun.

    Then the spring of hope begins  
    and eyes shine with fire and storm...

    Still, no one notices, and the crowds walk by.  
    But a process has begun  
    that one day might bloom

    Into the kind of words I'm looking for  
    to write, to express  
    how many of these dreams are of you.
