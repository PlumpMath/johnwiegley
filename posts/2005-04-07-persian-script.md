    As if my pen  
    had drunk too much  
    its joy beyond all keeping --  
    dancing across the page,  
    wild with meaning.

    A slender reed  
    thrumming with songs  
    of passion and Persian princes;  
    these are not mere lines,  
    but the tracings of a pen  
      turned whirling dervish.
