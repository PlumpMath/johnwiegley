    That love who is not,  
      knows not,  
      hears not,  
      feels not.

    But I know.  I feel.

    Enough feeling  
    of emptiness unsatisfied  
    to comprehend every unheard sorrow  
    every uncast shadow  
    ever corner  
    round which my hopes are caught  
    waiting for tomorrow.
