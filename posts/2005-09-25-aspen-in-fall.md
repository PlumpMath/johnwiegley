Yesterday I drove up to Aspen, Colorado on what might have been one of
the prettiest days of the year.  The weather was cool but warm, the
trees were changing color in indescribable patterns of brilliant gold
and yellow and red...  I was able to capture just [a few pictures](gallery/Colorado/Aspen/index.html),
although it does nothing to equal the beauty of the trip itself.  One a
day like that one, I realized that when men grow tired of the world,
it's the world of men they've had too much of.  Beauty like this seemed
like God's face, cloaked in the form of leaves and branches.  It was
among the most beautiful drives I've ever taken.
