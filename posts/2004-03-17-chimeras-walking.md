    Caprice, clad in epidermal cloth;  
    chimeras walking through the Valley of Death:  
    like a shapeshifter in the night,  
    a ghostly wisp of smoke,  
    a dazzle of moonlight on a glistening stone:  
    never the same, always changing.  
    Humans beings are a flux in the middle of the universe.
