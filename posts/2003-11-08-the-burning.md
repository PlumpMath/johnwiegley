    What do I learn  
    from the burning  
    of a woman's gaze  
    that turns my soul to ash?

    Only that:  
    ash floats finely  
    on the winter breeze,  
    lifting its way to heaven...

    While other souls,  
    content and warm,  
    deny the pain and gift  
    of spirit's leaven.
