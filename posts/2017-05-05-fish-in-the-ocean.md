title: A fish in the ocean

Consider yourself like a fish, swimming in the heart of the ocean, searching
for water... you think haven't found it because you don't swim fast enough, or
strong enough, or like the fishes of old; or that your lazy eye, your broken
scale, your weak fin is the reason. When, in fact, nothing can hold you back!

> A fish swims in the ocean, and no matter how far it swims there is no end to
  the water. A bird flies in the sky, and no matter how far it flies there is
  no end to the air. However, the fish and the bird have never left their
  elements. -- Dogen
