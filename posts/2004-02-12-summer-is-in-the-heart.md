Location: 325 Morrow Road

    lazily drifting on the breeze  
    scents of summer, jasmine and orange  
    the sun tinging all with gold  
    beneath skies of spotted blue  
    the music of leaves, of crickets  
    of midnight frogs in the trees  
    soft grass between my toes  
    the cool touch of the lake  
    and ringing tones of laughter...

    whatever season it may be  
    summer is in the heart.
