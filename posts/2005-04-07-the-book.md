    I awoke to find myself holding a book.  
    I did not know its language;  
    I could only look at the pictures,  
    imagining stories, the way children do.

    I began to study, to make an effort  
      to crack the code.  
    After which I noticed: the story had a Plot...

    Now I read as one who cannot take time for sleep!

    That book was my life, my world;  
    my understanding: what Your words finally taught me.
