    Slowly wends the winding river,  
    a snake asleep upon the land;  
    its waters wave left and rightward  
    its fish flash and bob and weave.

    The winds whip, the surface ripples:  
    the clear blue depths are gone;  
    and the starlight dances madly  
    as the waters move along.
