    Love is a beloved insanity.  
    If tongues could speak the tale  
    of love's madness,  
    no hearers would remain.

    They would, as one breath,  
    ascend ash-like upon the breeze  
    offering their hearts to the pyre --  
    and not a one complain.

    For when it touched my own lips,  
    it ruined my heart's kingdom.  
    Peace became a travesty:  
    my very hope was my despair.

    Where banners once flew in proud disdain  
    a king now weeps for his kingdom's bane.
