    The wind... the wind...  
    I remember the scent of the wind:  
    catching up the leaves into whirls of  
      red and brown,  
    gathering their varied fragrances of  
      oak and pine, dogwood and cherry.

    Their colors were like apricots,  
    mulberries or marmalade:  
    Scattered bits of potpourri flame,  
    floating along, swept by the wind...
