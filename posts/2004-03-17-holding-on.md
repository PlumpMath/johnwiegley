    Sadness sits down with me for tea,  
    and my cup fills up with tears.

    Emptiness grips me,  
    and the content is gone.

    Loneliness holds me,  
    and I cease to care.

    Depression finds me,  
    and it all fades to uniform black...

    But somewhere, there is a spark.  
    Otherwise I'd be already gone.
