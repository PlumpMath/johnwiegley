    I am a bow of strong wood  
    with forceful potential.  
    God has strung me  
    and knocked the arrow of my soul  
    pointed in His direction.  
    As I learn, I pull it back,  
    ever further, ever tighter.  
    Now it is taut:  
    to the breaking point.  
    All that is left for me  
    is to let go.
