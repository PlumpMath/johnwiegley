Because he writes like this:

> To want to see men and women standing tall as oaks, the sun rising warm upon their faces, whole, happy and unafraid; to see them healed of suffering in the light of that deep joy which pours itself out through their hearts and unites them in glory with all things; to want this for myself and all those I loved, and for everyone -- was this so wrong?

His *Danlo the Wild* series is still one of my all-time favorites, if a bit hard to find.  It took me years to finally get the full five books together.
